### Hi there üëã

I'm a research scientist at the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences of Oak Ridge National Laboratory where I work at the intersection of experimental physics and machine learning to accelerate discoveries of new materials. I am also very interested in the development of the machine learning-enabled ‚Äúsmart‚Äù automation of imaging and spectroscopic instrumentation. I received my Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2014, followed by a 3-year postdoctoral appointment at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
