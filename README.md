### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My expertise lies in designing and implementing custom machine learning solutions that drive research and development, with a current focus on AI-powered materials design and characterization. With a proven track record of collaborating closely with academic and industry partners, I excel at translating complex domain-specific challenges into efficient machine learning codes and workflows. During my 9-year tenure at the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, I led the development of machine learning codes that enabled autonomous experimentation in scanning probe and electron microscopy, and were later extended to neutron scattering experiments, chemical synthesis, and battery state-of-health assessments. To support my peers, I have authored multiple widely used open-source software packages, such as AtomAI and GPax, which streamline machine learning integration into experimental research. I also introduced the concept of the Jupyter paper to enhance transparency and reproducibility in research. My vision for the future is one where human-AI collaboration paves the way for rapid scientific innovation and practical applications.
