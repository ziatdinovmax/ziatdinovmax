### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As an R&D scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, I specialize in the intersection of machine learning and experimental sciences. My current focus is on developing physics-informed machine learning workflows to enable autonomous experimentation with scanning probe and electron microscopes on classical and quantum materials. I'm also passionate about creating tools for autonomous atomic fabrication with electron beams and scanning probes. I earned my Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2014 and completed a postdoctoral appointment at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory before joining the lab permanently.
