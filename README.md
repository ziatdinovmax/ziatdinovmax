### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My expertise lies in designing and implementing custom machine learning solutions that drive research and development, with a focus on AI-powered decision-making. With a proven track record of collaborating closely with academic and industry partners, I excel at translating complex domain-specific challenges into efficient machine-learning codes and workflows.Â During my 9-year tenure at the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, I was responsible for developing machine learning codes that enabled autonomous experimentation in scanning probe and electron microscopy, and were later extended to neutron scattering experiments, chemical synthesis, and battery state-of-health assessments. My primary interest lies in developing the "smart labs" of the future, where human-AI collaboration paves the way for rapid scientific innovation and practical applications in various fields.
