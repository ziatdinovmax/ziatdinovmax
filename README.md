### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an R&D scientist at the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where I work at the intersection of experimental physics and machine learning. I am particularly interested in developing physics-based machine learning approaches to enable autonomous experimentation in the scanning probe and electron microscopy on classical and quantum materials. I am also very excited about creating tools for autonomous atomic fabrication with electron beams and scanning probes. I received my Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2014, followed by a 3-year postdoctoral appointment at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
